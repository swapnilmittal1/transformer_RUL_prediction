# Transformer for RUL prediction

Custom Transformer model using PyTorch, including multi-head attention and convolutional layers, to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machinery.

## Quick Run

Run `python train.py --dataset FD001`in your terminal and you will get testing results for each epoch with the Root Mean Square Error from the test set.

## Environment Details
```
numpy==1.24.3
pandas==2.0.1
matplotlib==3.7.1
torch==2.0.1
Flask==2.3.2
